# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Easiers:

1. Click enter to add todo item
2. up and down, you need arrow icon
3. Ability to edit
4. Make it looks pretty
5. responvie / Center the app
6. Make the input autofocus when you first load the page

   Harder problem :

7. Ability to mark todo as completed
8. Edit functionality
9. When you amrk todo as completed, it needs to move to the bottom of the list
